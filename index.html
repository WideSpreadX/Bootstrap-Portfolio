            <p>Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Jonathan Olson. I grew up in Cromwell, CT, which was a smaller
                town before everyone found out about it. I was really big into sports, I actually got batting MVP in an
                international tournament in Dominican Republic. I also played Soccer, Basketball and Football. For fun I
                would ride quads and dirtbikes, go hiking, and of course some video games here and there.</p>
            <p>My education was through private schools consisting of The Independent Day School (K-8) and Xavier High
                School. I love math and science. I love technology. I won the "Invention Convention" in the 3rd grade,
                for a fire safety mechanism that would alert and extinguish a fire on your christmas tree (back when
                christmas lighting always caught on fire). I am currently attending a tech bootcamp for Web Development.

            <p>Don't get me started with work...because I won't stop. Not sure what it is, but I can't get enough it.
                Meaningful work at least. I do everything in my power to help someone. I think my favorite trait about
                me is, I don't stop.</p>
